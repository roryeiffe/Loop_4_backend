# Out of The Loop Take 4

This project is the 4th iteration of a personal project of mine. A few years ago, I discovered this game: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tastyrook.loop&hl=en_US&gl=US

It is a game of deception and tricking others into thinking you know the answer and figuring out who is the faker. In the past, I've used technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS and reacreated this app using front-end only. 

This time, I plan to use technologies like ReactJS, Redux, Bootstrap, Spring Boot, and MySQL to make a full-stack recreation of the game. 

Furthermore, I plan to write my own questions and categories to make this app completely original, besides the original concept of the game. 
## Technologies used:
- ReactJS
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Java
- Spring Boot
